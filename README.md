# 👋 Hi!

I'm Laurence, I host hackathons at McGill University, and work on robotics & ML research projects. 

### I'm currently:

* Developing coding evals for LLMs at the Rootly (YC S21) AI Lab (with workshop papers at ACL 2025 and NeurIPS 2025)
* Researching perception and planning for robots (contributing to reserach at labs at McGill, Mila and UBC)
* Hosting workshops and reading group meetups on topics in machine learning

### I've previously worked on:

* Building vision & ML models for space robotics at MDA Space
* Itegrating LLM evals at Groq
* Designing visualization tools and models to evaluate drone motor performance at **[ACSL](https://www.acsl.co.jp/en/)**, Japan's largest industrial drone manufacturer
* Core API development at early-stage startups 
* Organizing hackathons since 2018 (prev. Sponsorship Lead at [@hackmcgill](https://github.com/hackmcgill))
* Researching efficient machine learning (co-authored workshop paper at ICML 2024 on state space model distillation)


### I'd love to connect!
